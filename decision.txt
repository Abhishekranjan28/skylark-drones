                                        Decision Log
1. Key Assumptions

The Deals board contains deal value, stage, sector, probability, and close date fields.
The Work Orders board tracks project execution and may optionally be linked to Deals via a Connect Boards column.
Founder-level questions are high-level and may not reference specific field names.
Data may be incomplete, inconsistent, or messy.

2. Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture:

Monday API Layer – Fetches live board data dynamically via GraphQL (read-only).
Data Cleaning Layer – Normalizes text, dates, currency, and handles missing values.
LLM Query Planner (Gemini) – Converts natural language questions into structured JSON analysis plans.
Deterministic Execution Engine – Executes analysis plan safely in Python.
Data Quality Layer – Computes missing values, invalid rows, and forecast confidence.
LLM Insight Layer – Generates executive-level narrative insights.
Transparency Layer – Displays generated plan and computed metrics.
This separation ensures numeric accuracy while leveraging LLM reasoning.

3. Why Deterministic Computation Instead of Full LLM Computation?

Although LLMs can perform arithmetic, deterministic Python execution was used to:
Prevent hallucinated numbers
Ensure financial correctness
Improve reproducibility
Maintain scalability
Allow auditability of results

The LLM is used for:
Query planning
Strategic explanation
All numeric computation is handled by Python.

4. Data Resilience Strategy

To handle messy real-world data:

Null normalization ("", null, None)
Text standardization (lowercasing, trimming)
Stage normalization (won/lost mapping)
Currency cleaning (removing symbols, coercing to numeric)
Date parsing with invalid date detection
Missing value percentage reporting
Forecast confidence scoring
Automatic caveat injection into executive summary

The agent communicates:
Missing deal values
Missing close dates
Invalid numeric entries
Forecast reliability score

5. Query Understanding Approach

Instead of rule-based intent mapping, Gemini generates a structured analysis plan:

{
  "board": "deals",
  "analysis": "pipeline",
  "filters": {
    "sector": "energy",
    "time_period": "current_quarter"
  }
}


This allows:
Flexible interpretation
Support for new metrics
Reduced hardcoding
More production-aligned architecture

6. Business Intelligence Capabilities

The agent can answer:
Revenue queries
Pipeline health
Sector performance
Time-based analysis
Execution metrics
Cross-board comparisons
Data reliability analysis

7. Interpretation of “Leadership Updates”

I interpreted leadership updates as:
A structured executive briefing including:
Revenue performance
Pipeline summary
Win rate
Execution volume
Risk signals
Data quality caveats
Strategic recommendations
The output is formatted for board-level review.

8. Trade-offs

Decision	Reason
Streamlit	Rapid deployment
Gemini API	Strong reasoning + cost-effective
In-memory processing	Simpler infra within
Deterministic engine	Financial accuracy


9. What I Would Improve With More Time

Async caching layer
Automated QoQ trend analysis
Anomaly detection
Capacity vs pipeline risk scoring
Slide-ready PDF export
Multi-board schema auto-detection
Persistent conversation memory
